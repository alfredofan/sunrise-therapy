Hooks:

- Location: src/hooks/
- Purpose: The "hooks" folder is where you organize custom React hooks. Custom hooks are JavaScript functions that allow you to reuse stateful logic across different components. By placing them in a dedicated "hooks" folder, you can keep your codebase organized and make it easier to locate and reuse hooks throughout your application.

src/
|-- hooks/
| |-- useExample.js

- Example: Suppose you have a custom hook named useExample that encapsulates some logic. This hook could be used in various components across your application.

---

// src/hooks/useExample.js
import { useState } from 'react';

const useExample = () => {
const [value, setValue] = useState('');

const handleChange = (newValue) => {
setValue(newValue);
};

return {
value,
handleChange,
};
};

export default useExample;

---

Usage: You can then use this custom hook in your components:

---

// src/components/home/Home.js
import React from 'react';
import useExample from '../../hooks/useExample';

const Home = () => {
const { value, handleChange } = useExample();

return (
<div>
<input type="text" value={value} onChange={(e) => handleChange(e.target.value)} />
</div>
);
};

export default Home;
