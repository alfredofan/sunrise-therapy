Components:

- Location: src/components/
- Purpose: The "components" folder is where you organize reusable and modular components. These components are often shared across different pages or features of your application.
- Examples: Common UI elements like buttons, navigation bars (Header, Footer), and more complex components that can be reused in various parts of the application.
